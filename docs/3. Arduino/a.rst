3. Arduino Tutorial
===================

3.1 Data download
-----------------

Please note: The library files and code used by Arduino are available
for download only at this location. No further download options will be
provided thereafter.

Data download: :download:`Arduino Data <./Arduino.7z>`

3.2 Software Download
---------------------

When we get control board, we need to download Arduino IDE and driver
firstly.

You could download Arduino IDE from the official
website:https://www.arduino.cc/en/software.

There are various versions for Arduino,just download a suitable version
for your system,we will take WINDOWS system as an example to show you
how to download and install.

|image1|

You just need to click JUSTDOWNLOAD,then click the downloaded file to
install it.

And when the ZIP file is downloaded,you can directly unzip and start it.

|image2|

Installation and configuration of ESP32 environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Click “File” and select “Preferences”.

   |image3|

2. Click“\ |image4| ”，Copy and paste the ESP32 development board link:
   ``https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json``
   into the text box, then click ‘**OK**’.

   |image5|

3. Click ‘OK’ again.

   |image6|

4. Click the small development board icon on the left to open the
   development board options.

|image7|

5. In the development board search box, search for “ESP32”, select
   version “2.0.6”, and click install.

|image8|

**Note: You can see the installation progress of the development board
in the lower right corner. Please wait a few minutes for the
installation to complete. During the installation, keep your network
stable. If the installation fails, repeat the above steps and reinstall
the development board.**

|image9|

Add Library
~~~~~~~~~~~

Libraries are a collection of code that makes it easy for you to connect
to a sensor,display, module, etc.

There are hundreds of additional libraries available on the Internet for
download.

We will introduce the most simple way for you to add libraries .

Locate the “Libraries” folder within the materials downloaded at the
outset, and note its path on your computer; this is of paramount
importance.

|image10|

This method can only import one library file at a time, so we need to
repeat the process to import all library files. (Here we demonstrate
importing only the AsyncTCP.zip library file; it is advisable to import
all libraries at this stage to avoid forgetting in subsequent lessons.)

|image11|

Driver Check
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here we need to verify whether the drivers are installed on the
computer.

1. Without connecting the ESP32 development board to the computer, open
   the port as shown below. Note the available port options; as
   illustrated, only COM1 is present.

|image12|

2. Close the previously opened path and return to the programming
   interface. Connect the ESP32 development board to the computer, then
   reopen the port to check for new port options. As shown below, COM6
   now appears.

|image13|

3. At this point, COM6 is the port for the ESP32 development board,
   confirming that the drivers have been automatically installed.
4. If no new ports appear after connecting to the motherboard, please
   replace the data cable and try a different USB port on the computer.
   Should the issue persist, refer to the ‘**Driver installation**’
   section to install the driver.

|image14|

Software Configuration Check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, we have completed all software configurations. Now
connect the ESP32 development board to the computer and verify that the
environment is functioning correctly.

|image15|

Note: We can simply upload the default code directly. Successful upload
confirms our environment configuration is working correctly, as
demonstrated in the animated gif.

3.3 Project
-----------

Project 1 LED Blinking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1.Description**

LED blinking is a simple project designed for starters. You only need to
install an LED on Arduino board and upload the code on Arduino IDE. This
project reinforces the lear ning of Arduino conceptual framework and
using methods for starters.

**2. Working Principle**

|image16|

- **LED:** The above is the circuit diagram of LED. Generally speaking,
  limited IO ports of output current may cause low brightness of LED, so
  a NPN triode (Q2) is applied in circuit as a switch. In this case, the
  LED will light up if the base(pin 1) of triode is at a high level. On
  the contrary, LED goes off when the base is at low.

- **Triode switch:** To have a clear idea of its principle, certain
  knowledge of electronic circuit is required. For details, please
  consult materials by yourself. Briefly, LED on and off rely on the
  high and low levels of triode base, which are decided by the pin on
  the development board. LED lights up when the base(pin 1) is at a high
  level, and it goes off when the base is at low.

**3.Wiring Diagram：**

|image17|

**4.Upload Code**

::

   /*
     keyestudio ESP32 Inventor Learning Kit
     Project 1: LED Blinking
     http://www.keyestudio.com
   */
   int ledPin = 5; //Define LED to connect with pin IO5
   void setup() 
   {
     pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);//Set the mode to output
   }

   void loop() 
   {
     digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); //Output a high level, LED lights up
     delay(1000);//Delay 1000ms 
     digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); //Output a low level, LED goes off
     delay(1000);
   }

**5.Test Result**

After uploading the code and powering on, LED will light up for 1s and
off for 1 s.

Project 2 Breathing LED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1.Description**

Arduino breathing led utilizes on-board programmable PWM to output
analog waveform. After powering on, LED brightness can be adjusted
through duty cycle of the waveform to eventually realize the effect of
breathing led.

In this way, ambient light can be simulated by changing LED brightness
over time. Also, breathing led can form a colorful mini light to
construct a tranquil and warm environment.

**2. What is PWM?**

PWM controls analog output via digital means, which is able to adjust
duty cycle of the wave (a signal circularly shifting between high level
and low level).

For Arduino, digital ports of voltage output are LOW and HIGH, which
respectively correspond to 0V and 5V. Generally, we define LOW as 0 and
HIGH as 1. Arduino will output 500 signals of 0 or 1 within 1s. If they
are “1”, 5V will be output. Oppositely, if they are all 0, the output
will be 0V. Or if they are 010101010101…, the average output will be
2.5V.

In other words, output ratio of 0 and 1 affects the voltage value, the
more 0 and 1 signals are output per unit time, the more accurate the
control will be.

The GPIO34, 35, 36, and 39 of ESP32 cannot use PWM.

   */
   #define PIN_LED   5   //define the led pin
   #define CHN       0   //define the pwm channel
   #define FRQ       1000  //define the pwm frequency
   #define PWM_BIT   8     //define the pwm precision

   void setup() 
   {
     ledcSetup(CHN, FRQ, PWM_BIT); //setup pwm channel
     ledcAttachPin(PIN_LED, CHN);  //attach the led pin to pwm channel
   }

   void loop() 
   {
     for (int i = 0; i < 255; i++) //make light fade in
     { 
       ledcWrite(CHN, i);
       delay(10);
     }
     for (int i = 255; i > -1; i--) //make light fade out
     {  
       ledcWrite(CHN, i);
       delay(10);
     }
   }

**5.Test Result**

After uploading the code, we will see the LED slowly brighten and dim,
just like the rhythm of breathing.

           delay(100);                           //Delay 100ms
       } 
       delay(5000);// Wait 5s before repeating S.0.S
   }

**4. Test Result**

After the code is successfully uploaded, we can see that the LED flashes
3 times quickly, then flashes 3 times slowly and then flashes 3 times
quickly, alternating between fast and slow.

Project 4 Traffic Light
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

The traffic light module is a device used to control the route of
pedestrians and vehicles. It includes a red, a yellow and a green light,
which implies different instructions.

**Red for Stop:** Pedestrians and vehicles stop proceeding.

**Yellow for Caution:** Pedestrians and vehicles are ready for stopping.
If the drive is already in process, the speed should be slow.

**Green for Proceed:** Pedestrians and vehicles keep going with the
abidance of traffic regulations.

In this project, you can use Arduino to write code to control traffic
lights. For instance, set the duration of each lights and the interval
time among them. Besides, you may also add a timer to alter light colors
to schedule.

**2. Wiring Diagram**

circulation.

Project 5 Rainbow Ambient Light
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

Arduino 2812RGB LED is a programable colorful dreamy light, whose color,
brightness and rhythm are adjustable. This rainbow ambient light can be
used as a dynamic decoration at will. Or you may control it to “dance
with music”. Importantly, it can be improved as an alarm. Its built-in
sensor detects the ambient surroundings to warn users by changing its
color, brightness and rhythm.

**2. Working Principle**

|image22|

The data protocol adopts communication mode of single-line
return-to-zero code. After the pixel is reset on power, DIN terminal
receives data from the controller. The firstly arriving 24bit data will
be extracted by the first pixel and be sent to the inner data register.

Remaining data will be amplified by an amplification circuit and be
transmitted through DOUT port to the next cascaded pixel. Being
transmitted through pixels, the signal decreases 24bit each time.

Besides, The pixel adopts automatic shaping and forwarding technology,
insomuch that the cascade number of the pixel is only limited by the
signal transmission speed.

Project 6 Water Flow Light
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

This simple water flow light project enables to help you learn
electronic packaging. In this project, we will control LEDs to change
the color in a specified speed via a Arduino board.

**2. Wiring Diagram**

|image25|

**3. Test Code**

A water flow light means that LED lights go from left to right and then
from right to left. In this experiment, we use continuous pins, so that
“for” statement can be utilized not only to set output mode (replace
pins with circular variable in code) but to output.

Project 7 Active Buzzer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1.Description**

An active buzzer is a component used as an alarm, a reminder or an
entertaining device, which boasts a reliable sound.What’s more, it
empowers to stimulate highly controllable sounds, making our projects
more interesting.

**2. Working Principle**

|image26|

An active buzzer integrates a multi-vibrator, so it makes sound only via
DC voltage. Pin 1 of the buzzer connects to VCC and pin 2 is controlled
by a triode. When a high level is provided for the base (pin 1) of the
triode, its collector (pin 3) and emitter (pin 2) link to GND, and then
the buzzer emits sound.

Oppositely, if we offer a low level to the base, the rest of pins will
be disconnected, so the buzzer will remain quiet.

**3. Wiring Diagram**

|image27|

**4. Test Code**

::

    /*
     keyestudio ESP32 Inventor Learning Kit
     Project 7 Active Buzzer
     http://www.keyestudio.com
   */
   int buzzer = 5; //Define buzzer connected to IO5 pin 

   void setup() 
   {
     pinMode(buzzer, OUTPUT);//Set the output mode 
   }

   void loop() 
   {
     digitalWrite(buzzer, HIGH); //IO5 pin outputs a high level to cause the buzzer to emit sound 
     delay(1000);                  //Delay 1000ms
     digitalWrite(buzzer, LOW); //IO5 outputs a low level to prevent the buzzer to emit sound 
     delay(1000);
   }

**5. Test Result**

After uploading code and powering on, the buzzer emits sound for 1s and
stays quiet for 1s.

Project 8 Music Performer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

In this project, we will use a power amplifier speaker to play music.
This speaker can not only play simple songs, but also perform what you
desire. Thus, you can program other interesting codes in the project to
accomplish splendid learning outcomes.

**2. Working Principle**

|image28|

The electrical signal is input from pin 1 of RP1 (adjusts signal
intensity, which is also the sound volume).

After coupling in C4 and passing R5, the signal reaches IN- pin of
8002B, in which it is operationally amplified and output to BEE1
speaker.

Project 9 Digital Tube Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

This 4-Digit tube display is a device used to display counting or time,
which is able to display numbers from 0 ~ 9 and simple letters. It
consists of four digital tubes, each of which has seven light-emitting
diodes (LED).

Moreover, multiple functions can be realized by connecting their pins to
the Arduino development board, such as timekeeping and some game
storing.

**2. Working Principle**

|image33|

TM1650 utilizes IIC protocol and adopts two bus lines (SDA and SCL).

**Data Command:** 0x48. This command tells TM1650 to light up the
digital tubes rather than key scanning.

**Display Command:**

|image34|

Actually, it is one byte of data with different bits representing
different functions. **bit[6:4]:** Set the brightness of LED. Note that
000 indicates the brightest. **bit[3]:** Determine whether there is a
decimal dot. **bit[0]:** Determine whether to turn on the display.

**Digital Tube Turns on** Take an example: Level 8 brightness without a
dot signifies 0x05. Steps: Starting signal — Send 0x48 — Slave-device
receives — Send 0x05 — Slave-device receives — Ending signal After
turning on, there is no need to repeatedly send 0x48, as the function of
digital tube has confirmed. Besides, the brightness and display methods
can be enumerated with multiple data in one place, so that it is clear
and space-saving.

**Digital Tube Turns off** Steps: Starting signal — Send 0x48 —
Slave-device receives — Send 0x00 — Slave-device receives — Ending
signal

**Digital Tube Displays Numbers** We firstly tell TM1650 to display
numbers on the predetermined tube. And then the number will be
displayed. Its eight bit corresponds to eight segment, with 1 for
lighting up and 0 for lighting off. If there is a doubt of the
corresponding relation, you may light up bit by bit in loop.

For example, when bit 1 is turned on and displays 8, the data is 0x68.
If there is a dot, 8 will also be displayed when sending 0x7f. Steps:
Starting signal — Send 0x68 — Slave-device receives — Send 0x7f —
Slave-device receives — Ending signal Result: 8 is displayed on Bit 1.

For convenience, an array of corresponding value to 0~9 can be made.
After further improvement, it is able to display numbers, adjust
brightness, shift the decimal dot and tubes.

Project 10 Dot Matrix Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

This module consists of a 8x8 LED dot matrix with one control pin for
each row as well as each column to adjust the brightness of LED.
Connecting with Arduino board, the brightness of LED is controlled to
display characters and figures via Arduino programming. In this way,
simple characters, numbers and figures are able to be displayed. It also
can be applied in game machines or screens.

**2. Working Principle**

|image37|

MAX7219 is an IC with SPI communication and can be used to control the
8x8 dot matrix. The MAX7219 SPI communication has integrated in our
libraries and you can recall directly.

Project 12 Servo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

This servo features high performance and high precision with a maximum
rotation angle of 180°. Weighting only 9g, it is perfectly suitable for
any mini device in multiple occasions. What’s more, it enjoys short
startup time, low noise and strong stability.

**2. Working Principle**

**Angle range:** 180° (360°, 180° and 90°)

**Drive voltage:** 3.3V or 5V

**Pin:** Three wires

|image49|

**GND:** Grounded(brown)

**VCC:** A red pin that connects to a +5v (3.3V) power

**S:** A orange signal pin that controlled via PWM signal

|image50|

**Control Principle**: The rotation angle is controlled via duty cycle
of PWM. Theoretically, standard PWM cycle is 20ms(50Hz), so pulse width
should distribute within 1ms~2ms. However, the actual pulse width
reaches 0.5ms~2.5ms, which corresponds to 0°～180°. Pay attention that,
for the same signal, the rotation angle may vary from servo brands.

**3. Wiring Diagram**

|image51|

Add an external power source instead of just using USB for power.

|image52|

**4. Test Code**

::

   int servoPin = 4;//servo PIN

   void setup() 
   {
     pinMode(servoPin, OUTPUT);//servo pin is set to output
   }

   void loop() 
   {
     for(int i = 0 ; i <= 180 ; i++) 
     {
      servopulse(servoPin, i);//Set the servo to rotate from 0° to 180°
     delay(10);//delay 10ms
     }
     for(int i = 180 ; i >= 0 ; i--) 
     {
      servopulse(servoPin, i);//Set the servo to rotate from 180° to 0°
     delay(10);//delay 10ms
     }
   }

   void servopulse(int pin, int myangle) 
   { //Impulse function
     int pulsewidth = map(myangle, 0, 180, 500, 2500); //Map Angle to pulse width
     for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
     { //Output a few more pulses
       digitalWrite(pin, HIGH);//Set the servo interface level to high
       delayMicroseconds(pulsewidth);//The number of microseconds of delayed pulse width value
       digitalWrite(pin, LOW);//Lower the level of servo interface
     }
   }

**5. Test Result**

After connecting the wiring and uploading code, the servo starts to
rotate from 0° to 180° and then reverse.

**Project 13 Mini Lamp**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

In this project, we are going to control a lamp via Arduino UNO and a
button. When we press the button, the state of the lamp will shift(ON or
OFF).

**2. Working Principle**

|image53|

When the button is released, a voltage VCC passing through R29 provides
a high level for S terminal. When pressed, pin 1 and 3, pin 2 and 4 are
connected and voltage on S1 arrives GND as a low level. At this moment,
R29 avoids a short circuit between VCC and GND.

**3. Wiring Diagram**

|image54|

**4. Test Code**

::

   /*
     keyestudio ESP32 Inventor Learning Kit 
     Project 13.1 Mini Lamp

   */
   int button = 15;
   int value = 0;

   void setup() 
   {
     Serial.begin(9600); //Set the serial baud rate to 9600 
     pinMode(button, INPUT);  //Connect the button pin to digital port 8 and set it to input mode.
   }

   void loop() 
   {
     value = digitalRead(button);//Read the button value 
     Serial.print("Key status:"); //Print "Key status:" on serial port 
     Serial.println(value); //Print the button variable on the serial port and wrapping lines
   }

**5. Test Result**

After connecting the wiring and uploading code, open the serial monitor
and set the baud rate to 9600. When we press the button, serial port
prints “Key status: 0”; When we release it, serial port prints “Key
status: 1”.

Project 15 Responder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

This programmable responder inputs and receives signals through Arduino
development board and a group of buttons, and it judges the correctness
of answers via a LED. It is a good object to exercise students’ reaction
ability and draw their attention to questions. If the answer is correct,
the respondent obtains a lot scores.

Moreover, it simplifies teachers’ manipulation of question-grabbers and

Let’s simulate a quick-answer game.

Press the red button to turn off all LED lights. Then we can select the
yellow, green and blue buttons to turn on the corresponding LED lights.
The person whose LED light turns on first can answer first.

Project 16 Timebomb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

This project will give you an opportunity experience an interesting
timebomb game.

In this project, the dot matrix represents your timebomb, while the
digital tube displays remaining time. Buttons can not only control the
bomb but also set its time. You may set a countdown to control this
bomb, and it explodes when the countdown is over. Beyond that, a buzzer
is adopted to alarm.

Anyhow, by programming on multiple sensors, your comprehensive
capability of logic thinking can be enhanced.

**5. Test Result**

After connecting the wires and uploading the code, the blue button
(increase) and green button (decrease) can be used to set the time, and
the yellow button can be used to count down. When the countdown ends,
the smiley face on the Dot Matrix Display turns into a crying face,
simulating the explosion of the bomb. Pressing the red button can reset
the program.

Project 17 Invasion Alarm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

This invasion alarm system is able to detect invaders in houses or small
offices and warn the host to take measures in time.

In this project, the sensor monitors a certain area. Some device on
Arduino board will trigger LED to light up and buzzer to beep for
caution if a movement is detected in that zone.

Virtually, this module features practicability, easy installation and
low costs. With the exception of home and office, it also applies to
factories, warehouses and markets, which, to a large extent, protects
property security.

**2. Working Principle**

|image63|

Human body(37°C) always emits infrared ray with a wavelength of 10μm,
which approximates to that of the sensor detected.

On this account, this module is able to detects human beings movement.
If there is, PIR sensor outputs a high level about 3s. If not, it
outputs a low level .

**4. Test Code**

::

   /*
     keyestudio ESP32 Inventor Learning Kit  
     Project 17.1 Invasion Alarm
     http://www.keyestudio.com
   */
   int pir = 5;    //Define IO5 as PIR sensor pin 

   void setup() 
   {
     pinMode(pir,INPUT);   //Set IO5 pin to input 
     Serial.begin(9600);
   }

   void loop() 
   {
     int pir_val = digitalRead(pir);   //Read the PIR result and assign it to pir_val 
       Serial.print("pir_val:"); //Print “pir_val”
       Serial.println(pir_val);
       delay(500);
   }

**5. Test Result**

After connecting the wiring and uploading the code, open serial monitor
to set baud rate to 9600, and the serial port prints the PIR value. If
the PIR sensor detects a person, it will display 1.

|image65|

**6. Knowledge** Expansion

Let’s make an invasion alarm. When the PIR sensor detects human, LED
lights up and the buzzer emits sound. In contrast, LED goes off and the
buzzer stays quiet.

   */
   int pir = 5;        //Set PIR sensor pin to IO5
   int red_led = 18;   //Set red LED to pin IO18
   int buzz = 19;      //Set buzzer to pin IO19

   void setup() 
   {
     // put your setup code here, to run once:
     pinMode(pir,INPUT);       //Set PIR pin to input mode 
     pinMode(red_led,OUTPUT);  //Set LED pin to output mode  
     pinMode(buzz,OUTPUT);     //Set buzzer pin to output mode 
   }

   void loop() 
   {
     // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
     int pir_val = digitalRead(pir);
     if(pir_val == 1)
     {
       digitalWrite(red_led,HIGH);
       digitalWrite(buzz,HIGH);
     }
     else
     {
       digitalWrite(red_led,LOW);
       digitalWrite(buzz,LOW);
     }
   }

**Test Result**

If the PIR sensor detects a person nearby, the red LED will light up and
the buzzer will sound.
