Project 19 Dimming Lamp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

The dimming lamp adjusts the brightness of LED via a potentiometer and
an Arduino controller. The brightness is subject to resistance value,
which can be read and adjusted by connecting the ends of the
potentiometer to digital or analog pins on board. What’s more, this
system is applied to control voltage or current of other devices such as
fans, bulbs and heaters.

**2. Working Principle**

|image2|

|image3|

Essentially, potentiometer is an element that can change the value of
resistance. According to Ohm’s law(U=I*R), the resistance affects the
voltage. Our potentiometer is 10K.

In this project, the maximum resistance is 10K. The ESP32 board will
equally divide the voltage of 3V into 4095 parts
(3/4095=0.0007326007326). The analog voltage is obtained by multiplying
the read value and 0.0007326007326.

**3. Wiring Diagram**

|image4|

**4. Test Code**

::

   /*
     keyestudio ESP32 Inventor Learning Kit  
      Project 19.1 Dimming Lamp
     http://www.keyestudio.com
   */
   int pot = 34;      //Define variable pot to IO34

   void setup() 
   {
     // put your setup code here, to run once:
     Serial.begin(9600);       //Set baud rate to 9600
   }

   void loop() 
   {
     // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
     int value = analogRead(pot);  //Read io34 and assign it to the variable value
     Serial.println(value);        //Print the variable value and wrap it around 
     delay(200);
   }

**5. Test Result**

After connecting the wiring and uploading code, open serial monitor to
set baud rate to 9600, and the analog value will be displayed, within
the range of 0-4095.Rotating the potentiometer can change the size of
the analog value.

|image5|

**6. Knowledge Expansion**

We will control the brightness of LED via a potentiometer. As we know,
it is influenced by PWM. However, the range of analog value is 0-4095
while that of PWM is 0-255. Thus, a “map(value, fromLow, fromHigh,
toLow, toHigh)” function is needed.

   /*

   int led = 25;       //Define LED to IO25
   int pot = 34;       //Define pot to IO34

   void setup() 
   {
     // put your setup code here, to run once:
     pinMode(led,OUTPUT);      //Set LED pin to output 
   }

   void loop() 
   {
     // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
     int value = analogRead(pot);
     int led_val = map(value,0,4095,0,255);  //Convert the range of potentiometer analog value to the range we need  
     analogWrite(led,led_val);
   }

**7. Test Result**

After the code is uploaded successfully, rotating the potentiometer will
change the brightness of the red LED.

Project 20 Light Pillar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

The resistance(less than 1KΩ) of the photoresistor varies from the
light, thus it can control the brightness of the dot matrix. When
controlling, we connect this resistor to an analog pin on the board to
monitor the change of resistance. In this way, the light automatically
controls the brightness of the display.

Besides, the photoresistor is widely applied to our daily life. For
instance, a curtain automatically opens or closes according to the outer
light intensity.

**2. Working Principle**

|image7|

|image8|

When it is totally in dark, the resistance equals 0.2MΩ, and the voltage
at signal terminal (point 2) approaches to 0V. The stronger the light is
, the smaller the resistance and voltage will be.

**3. Wiring Diagram**

|image9|

**4. Test Code**

::

   /*
     keyestudio ESP32 Inventor Learning Kit 
     Project 20.1 Light Pillar

   */
   int light = 34;      //Define light to IO34

   void setup() 
   {
     // put your setup code here, to run once:
     Serial.begin(9600);       //Set baud rate to 9600
   }

   void loop() 
   {
     // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
     int value = analogRead(light);    //Read IO34 and assign it to the variable value
     Serial.println(value);        //Print the variable value and wrap it around 
     delay(200);
   }

**5. Test Result**

After connecting the wiring and uploading code, open serial monitor to
set baud rate to 9600, the analog value will be displayed, withing the
range of 0-4095. Changing the light intensity around it can change its
value.

|image10|

**6. Knowledge Expansion**

We will use this photoresistor to sense the ambient light intensity. The
two columns of middle are included in this experiment to represent light
intensity. The stronger it is, the more lighted LEDs will be. This forms
a “light pillar”.

   const byte IMAGES[8] = {0x01,0x03,0x07,0x0F,0x1F,0x3F,0x7F,0xFF}; //Data of light pillar

   int light = 34;

   void setup() 
   {
     lc.shutdown(0,false);
     // Set brightness to a medium value
     lc.setIntensity(0,8);
     // Clear the display
     lc.clearDisplay(0);
     pinMode(light,INPUT);  
   }

   void loop()
   {
     int value = analogRead(light);
     int temp = map(value,0,4095,0,7);  //Convert the range of analog values to 0-7
     lc.setRow(0,3,IMAGES[temp]);      //Display the value of the array IMAGES[temp] in column 3
     lc.setRow(0,4,IMAGES[temp]);      //Display the value of the array IMAGES[temp] in column 4
   }

- **Test Result**

The stronger the light near the photoresistor, the higher the light
column of the LED matrix.

Project 21 Sound Controlled LED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

Sound controlled LED is a device used to detect sound in a way that
controls the brightness of LED, which is composed of a Arduino board and
some components. It can connect to multiple sensors such as microphones.
It converts sound to changing voltage signal to be received by Arduino
to control the LED on and off.

**2. Working Principle**

|image13|

When detecting a sound, the electret film in microphone vibrates, which
changes the capacitance and generates a subtle change of voltage.

Next, we make use of LM3 chip to build a proper circuit to amplify the
detected sound up, which can be adjusted by a potentiometer. Rotate it
clockwise to enlarge the times.

**3. Wiring Diagram**

|image14|

**4. Test Code**

::

   /*
     keyestudio ESP32 Inventor Learning Kit 
     Project 21.1：Sound Controlled LED
     http://www.keyestudio.com
   */
   int sound = 33; //Define sound as IO33

   void setup()
   {
     Serial.begin(9600);
     pinMode(sound,INPUT);
   }

   void loop()
   {
     int value = analogRead(sound);
     Serial.println(value);
   }

**5. Test Result**

After connecting the wiring and uploading code, open serial monitor to
set baud rate to 9600, the analog value will be displayed.

|image15|

**Sensitivity adjustment：**

If you feel that the sensitivity of the sound sensor is suitable, we can
adjust the potentiometer of the sound sensor(right for the highest
sensitivity, left for the lowest sensitivity).

|image16|

**6. Knowledge Expansion**

The commonly seen corridor light is a kind of sound controlled light.
Meanwhile, it also includes a photoresistor. Differed from that, here we
establish a model that an LED only is affected by sound. When the analog
volume exceeds 100, LED lights up for 2S and then goes off.

   int led = 25;      //Define led to IO25

   void setup()
   {
     pinMode(led,OUTPUT);   //Set IO25 to output 
   }

   void loop()
   {
     int value = analogRead(sound);    //Read analog value of IO33 and assign it to value
     if(value > 100)
     {                  //Judge whether value is greater than 100
       digitalWrite(led,HIGH);         //If IO25 pin outputs high level, LED lights up
       delay(2000);
     }
     else
     {
       digitalWrite(led,LOW);          //If IO25 pin outputs low level, LED lights off
     }
   }

- **Test Result**

When the value detected by the sound sensor is greater than 100, the red
LED will light up.

Project 23 Smart Cup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

In this project, we mainly adopt the Arduino development board to create
a programmable smart cup, which reveals the temperature of inner liquid
through a RGB indicator. It can control the brightness of the light by
setting a temperature threshold. If the threshold is exceeded, it will
get brighter. Otherwise, it gets darker.

The smart cup enables to help users better control the temperature of
their drinking water and effectively prevent overheating or freezing.

Project 25 Ultrasonic Rangefinder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

This ultrasonic rangefinder measures distance of obstacles by emitting
sound waves and then receiving the echo. That is to say, the distance is
not an immediate value, but an observed one by a theoretical calculation
of time difference between emitter and receiver.

Ultrasonic is able to detect the shape of objects, set up automatic
doors and estimate flow velocity and pressure.

What’s more, it supports cooperative works with computers. As a result,
the measured value can be transmitted to computers via Arduino board.

In daily life, it is widely used for motors, servos and LEDs as well as
systems(automatic navigation, control and security monitoring systems).

**2. Working Principle**

|image28|

As we all know, ultrasonic is a kind of inaudible sound wave signal with
high frequency. Similar to a bat, this module measures distance of
obstacles by calculating the time difference between wave-emitting and
echo-receiving.

**Maximum distance:** 3M

**Minimum distance:** 5cm

**Detection angle:** ≤15°

**6. Knowledge Expansion**

Let’s make a rangefinder.

We display characters on LCD 1602. Program to show “Keyestudio” at (3,0)
and “distance:” at (0,1) followed by the distance value at (9,1).

When the value is smaller than 100(or 10), a residue of the third(or the
second) bit still exists. Therefore, an “if” judgement is necessary to
determine a certain condition.

Project 27 Intelligent Parking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

This intelligent parking system detects and optimizes parking position
via an ultrasonic sensor. With this system, wrong parking is avoided to
a large extent.

Firstly, you need to install the sensor around the carpark. And then it
will detect the distance between the car and its edges and send the
information to the development board so as to control the car to
automatically adjust to the optimal parking position.

Project 28 Intelligent Gate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

The intelligent gate is an intelligent parking lot system that
integrates MCU and ultrasonic sensor, which automatically controls the
gate according to the distance of cars, so as to better control the car
access.

When a certain distance is reached, MCU receives the signal from the
sensor and estimates the distance via the signal intensity. If the car
is approaching or leaving, MCU will open or close the gate via a servo.

Project 29 IR Remote Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

The IR remote control uses IR signal to control LED, which greatly
simplifies the process of controlling LED.

**2. Working Principle**

|image40|

In this project, we often use a carrier of about 38K for modulation.

IR remote control system includes modulation, emitting and receiving. It
sends data through modulating, which improves the transmission
efficiency and reduces the power consumption.

Generally, the frequency of carrier modulation is within
30khz~60khz(usually 38kHz). The duty cycle of the square wave is 1/3, as
shown below, which is decided by the 455kHz crystal oscillator on the
emitting end.

An Integer frequency division is essential for crystal oscillator at
this end, and the frequency coefficient usually evaluates 12. Therefore,
455kHz÷12≈37.9kHz≈38kHz.

**38KH carrier (complete) emitting diagram:**

|image41|

**Carrier frequency:** 38KHz

**Wave length:** 940nm

**Receiving angle:** 90°

**Control distance:** 6M

Project 31 Connect the ESP32 board to WiFi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Description**

ESP32 boasts a built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth nodule that is widely used
in Internet of Things (IoT). With this function, it can remotely control
the data transmission through the wireless network.

In applications, ESP32 can be used as a client to connect to a Wi-Fi
network, or as a hotspot to create its own network. Through these
connections, ESP32 receives commands to control external devices, such
as turning on/off lights and adjusting temperature. In the code,
protocols like HTTP and MQTT are used to communicate with the server to
achieve data sending and receiving, so as to remotely control and
monitoring.

**2. ESP32 wifi**

ESP32 development board comes with built-in Wi-Fi (2.4G) and Bluetooth
(4.2), which enable it to easily connect to Wi-Fi network and
communicate with other devices in the network. You can display web pages
in your browser via ESP32.

· Base station mode (STA / Wi-Fi Client mode): ESP32 is connected to
Wi-Fi hotspot (AP).

· AP mode (Soft-AP / Wi-Fi hotspot mode): Wi-Fi device(s) is(are)
connected to ESP32.

· AP-STA mode: ESP32 is both Wi-Fi hotspot and a Wi-Fi device connected
to another Wi-Fi.

· These modes supports multiple security modes, including WPA, WPA2 and
WEP.

· It is able to scan Wi-Fi hotspot (active or passive)

· It support promiscuous mode monitoring IEEE802.11 Wi-Fi packets.

**3. Wiring Diagram**

|image49|

**Notes:**

1. You need to prepare a 2.4GHz frequency WIFI(not 5GHz). It can be a
   mobile hotspot or a router.

2. The ESP32 board consumes more power when connected to the network, so
   you need to connect an external power supply to this kit. We provide
   you with a 6XAA Battery Holder (battery not included), which you can
   connect to the DC port of the ESP32 integrated board.

   |image50|

3. Remember your wifi network name and password and fill it into the
   code before uploading it.

::

   const char* ssid = "your_SSID"; // Fill in WiFi name, for example,= "KEYES"
   const char* password = "your_password"; // Fill in WiFi password, for example,= "123456"

**4. Test Result**

After uploading the code, LCD1602 shows the IP address. Open the
browser, enter the IP address and you will see the control page.

At this time, you can use the control device to read the value read by
the sensor, and you can also control the on and off of the LED.
